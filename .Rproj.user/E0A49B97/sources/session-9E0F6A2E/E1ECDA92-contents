The focus of this lecture is on item analysis for surveys. We use information about alpha coefficients and item-total correlations (within and across subscales) to help assess what we might consider to be *within-scale convergent and discriminant validity* (although we tend to think of it as an assessment of reliability).

## Navigating this Lesson

There is about 45 minutes of lecture.  If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail.  All original materials are provided at the [Github site](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_Psychometrics) that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's [introduction](#ReCintro)

### Learning Objectives

Focusing on this week's materials, make sure you can:

* Define the corrected item-total correlation and compare it to an item-total correlation.
* List the preliminary steps essential for scale construction, beginning with item development.
* Name the type(s; e.g., reliability, validity) of psychometric evaluation that item analytic procedures assess..
* Identify threats to the interpretation of item-total correlations and alpha coefficients.
* Make decisions about item retention, deletion, and revision that balances statistical output with construct definitions.

### Planning for Practice

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. For this lesson, please locate item-level data for a scale that has the potential for at least two subscales  and a total-scale score. Ideally, the data you utilized in one or more of the prior lessons (e.g., changing the random seed in the lesson data, downloading the data from the *ReCentering Psych Stats* survey, or data you found elsewhere) will allow you to continue with these analyses.  Then, please examine the following:

* produce alpha coefficients, average inter-item correlations, and corrected item-total correlations for the total and subscales, separately
* produce correlations between the individual items of one subscale and the subscale scores of all other scales
* draft an APA style results section with an accompanying table.

In my example there were only two subscales. If you have more, you will need to compare each subscale with all the others. For example, if you had three subscales:  A, B, C, you would need to compare A/B, B/C, and A/C.

## Intro to Item Analysis for Survey Development

Item analysis can be used to decide which items to include and exclude from a scale or subscale.  The goal is to select a set of items that yields a summary score (total or mean) that is strongly related to the construct identified and defined in the scale. 

* Item analysis is somewhat limiting because we usually cannot relate our items to a direct (external) measure of a construct to select our items.
* Instead, we *trust* (term used lightly) that the items we have chosen, together, represent the construct and we make decisions about the relative strength of each item's correlation to the total score.
* This makes it imperative that we look to both statistics and our construct definition (e.g., how well does each item map onto the construct definition)

## Research Vignette

This lesson will also use the research vignette that presented the development and psychometric evaluation of the Perceptions of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale [@szymanski_perceptions_2020]. 

The scale is six items with responses rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (*strongly disagree*) to 7 (*strongly agree*). Higher scores indicate more negative perceptions of the LGBTQ campus climate. Szymanski and Bissonette [-@szymanski_perceptions_2020] have suggested that the psychometric evaluation supports using the scale in its entirety or as subscales composed of the following items:

* College response to LGBTQ students:  
  - My university/college is cold and uncaring toward LGBTQ students. (cold)
  - My university/college is unresponsive to the needs of LGBTQ students. (unresponsive) 
  - My university/colleg provides a supportive environment for LGBTQ students. [un]supportive; must be reverse-scored
* LGBTQ Stigma:  
  - Negative attitudes toward LGBTQ persons are openly expressed on my university/college campus. (negative)
  - Heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and cissexism are visible on my university/college campus. (heterosexism)
  - LGBTQ students are harassed on my university/college campus. (harassed)

A [preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332062781_Perceptions_of_the_LGBTQ_College_Campus_Climate_Scale_Development_and_Psychometric_Evaluation/link/5ca0bef945851506d7377da7/download) of the article is available at ResearchGate.Below is the script for simulating item-level data from the factor loadings, means, and sample size presented in the published article. 

```{r }
set.seed(210827)
SzyT1 <- matrix(c(.88, .73, .73, -.07,-.02, .16, -.03, .10, -.04, .86, .76, .71), ncol=2) #primary factor loadings for the two factors
rownames(SzyT1) <- c("cold", "unresponsive", "supportiveNR", "negative", "heterosexism", "harassed") #variable names for the six items
#rownames(Szyf2) <- paste("V", seq(1:6), sep=" ") #prior code I replaced with above
colnames(SzyT1) <- c("F1", "F2")
SzyCorMat <- SzyT1 %*% t(SzyT1) #create the correlation matrix
diag(SzyCorMat) <- 1
#SzyCorMat #prints the correlation matrix
SzyM <- c(2.31, 3.11, 2.40, 3.18, 4.44, 3.02) #item means
SzySD <- c(1.35, 1.46, 1.26, 1.60, 1.75, 1.50) #item standard deviations; turns out we won't need these since we have a covariance matrix
SzyCovMat <- SzySD %*% t(SzySD) * SzyCorMat #creates a covariance matrix from the correlation matrix
#SzyCovMat #displays the covariance matrix

dfSzyT1 <- as.data.frame(round(MASS::mvrnorm(n=646, mu = SzyM, Sigma = SzyCovMat, empirical = TRUE),0)) #creates the item level data from the sample size, mean, and covariance matrix
dfSzyT1[dfSzyT1>7]<-7 #restricts the upperbound of all variables to be 7 or less
dfSzyT1[dfSzyT1<1]<-1 #resticts the lowerbound of all variable to be 1 or greater
#colMeans(dfSzy) #displays column means

library(tidyverse)
dfSzyT1 <- dfSzyT1 %>% dplyr::mutate(ID = row_number()) #add ID to each row
dfSzyT1 <- dfSzyT1%>%dplyr::select(ID, everything())#moving the ID number to the first column; requires
dfSzyT1<- dfSzyT1 %>%
  dplyr::mutate(supportive = 8 - supportiveNR) #because the original scale had 1 reversed item, I reversed it so that we can re-reverse it for practice; reversing means subracting from 1 greater than the scaling of the scale (in our case 1 to 7, so we subtract from 8)
dfSzyT1 <- dfSzyT1%>%
  dplyr::select(-supportiveNR)
```

The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either a .csv file (think "Excel lite") or .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do).
```{r}
#write the simulated data  as a .csv
#write.table(dfSzyT1, file="dfSzyT1.csv", sep=",", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)
#bring back the simulated dat from a .csv file
#dfSzyT1 <- read.csv ("dfSzyT1.csv", header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#to save the df as an .rds (think "R object") file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with
#saveRDS(dfSzyT1, "dfSzyT1.rds")
#bring back the simulated dat from an .rds file
#dfSzyT1 <- readRDS("dfSzyT1.rds")
```

```{r}
psych::describe(dfSzyT1)
```

Although Szymanski and Bissonette report inter-item correlations, it does not appear that they used item analysis to guide their selection of items. In fact, it is not necessary to do so.  I like to teach item analysis because I think it provides a conceptual grounding for future lessons on exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.

## Steps to Item Analysis

If this is initial scale development, the researcher(s) are wise to write more items than needed so that there is flexibility in selecting items with optimal functioning. Szymaski and Bissonette [-@szymanski_perceptions_2020] do this. Their article narrates how they began with 36 items, narrowed it to 24, and -- on the basis of subject matter expertise and peer review --  further narrowed it to 10. The reduction of additional items happened on the basis of exploratory factor analysis.  

### Step I:  Corrected item-total correlations** 

*A within-scale version of convergent validity.*

* If needed, transform any items (i.e., reverse-coding) and calculate a total score.
* Calculate *corrected item-total correlations* by correlating each item to the total score LESS the item being evaluated.
  + to the degree that the item total represents the construct of interest, the items should be strongly correlated with the corrected total score
* Make decisions about items and scales.  For items that have low or negative correlations
  + consider deletion
  + consider revision (requires readministering the scale)
* Each time an item is deleted, the process needs to be run again because it changes the total-scale score.  
  + In fact, it's a very iterative process.  It could be that you "add back" a previously deleted item (once others are deleted) because with each deletion/addition the statistical construct definition is evolving.
* In multidimensional scales, if the total-scale score is ever used, researchers should conduct these separately for both the total-scale score and the subscales scores.
  
There are reasons to not "blindly follow the results of an item analysis" [@green_using_2010].

* **Method factors** (aka *method effects*) are common methods (e.g., negatively word items, common phrasing such as "My supervisor tells me" versus "I receive feedback") that are irrelevant to the characteristics or traits being measured -- yet when analyzed they share variance [@chyung_evidencebased_2018]. 
* Adequacy of construct representation. That is, how broad is the construct and to what degree do the items represent the entire construct? If the construct is broad, but there may be a tendency to:
  + write items on a particular, narrow, aspect of the construct, ignoring others
  + one or more items to strongly correlate, tempting us to delete items that are not as strongly correlated (although they represent the construct)

This means we should think carefully and simultaneously about:

* statistical properties of the item and overall scale
* construct definition
* scale structure (unidimensional?  multidimensional?  hierarchical?)

**Step II:  Correlation of each subscale's items with other subscale totals**

This provides a within-scale version of discriminant validity.

* Calculate scale scores for each of the subscales of a measure.
* Focusing on one subscale at a time, correlate each of the subscale's items with the total scores of all the other subscales.
* Comparing to the results of Step I's corrected item-total process, each item should have stronger correlations with its own items (i.e., the corrected item-total correlation) than with the other subscale total scores.


### Data Prep

Let's do the operational work to get all the pieces we need:

1. Reverse-code the *supportive* variable
2. Raw data for each of the scales
   * total-scale score
   * campus response subscale
   * stigma subscale
2. Mean scale scores for total and subscale scores
3. A merged dataset with the raw, item-level, data PLUS the three mean scores (total, college response, stigma)

If we look at the information about this particular scale, we recognize that the *supportive* item is scaled in the opposite direction of the rest of the items.  That is, a higher score on *supportive* would indicate a positive perception of the campus climate for LGBTQ individuals whereas higher scores on the remaining items indicate a more negative perception. Before moving forward, we must reverse score this item.

In doing this, I will briefly note that in this case I have given my variables one-word names that represent each item. Many researchers (including myself) will often give variable names that are alpha numerical:  LGBTQ1, LGBTQ2, LGBTQ*n*. Either is acceptable. In the psychometrics case, the one-word names may be useful shortcuts as one begins to understand the inter-item relations.

In reverse-scoring the *supportive* item, I will rename it "unsupportive" as an indication of its reversed direction.

```{r}
dfSzyT1<- dfSzyT1 %>%
  dplyr::mutate(unsupportive = 8 - supportive) #scaling 1 to 7; so we subtract from 8

psych::describe(dfSzyT1)
```

Next, we score the items. In our simulation, we have no missing data. Using an available information approach (AIA; [@parent_handling_2013]) where it is common to allow 20-25% missingness, we might allow the total-scale score to calculate if there is 1 variable missing; but none for the subscale scores. The *mean_n()* function in the *sjstats* packages is especially helpul for this. 

```{r}
LGBTQvars <- c('cold', 'unresponsive', 'negative', 'heterosexism', 'harassed', 'unsupportive')
ResponseVars <- c('cold', 'unresponsive', 'unsupportive')
Stigmavars <- c('negative', 'heterosexism', 'harassed')

dfSzyT1$TotalT1 <- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzyT1[,LGBTQvars], .80)#will create the mean for each individual if 80% of variables are present (this means there must be at least 5 of 6)
dfSzyT1$ResponseT1 <- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzyT1[,ResponseVars], .80)#will create the mean for each individual if 80% of variables are present (in this case all variables must be present)
dfSzyT1$StigmaT1 <- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzyT1[,Stigmavars], .80)#will create the mean for each individual if 80% of variables are present (in this case all variables must be present)
```

While we are at it, let's just create tiny dfs with just our variables of interest.
```{r}
LGBTQT1 <- dplyr::select(dfSzyT1, cold, unresponsive, unsupportive, negative, heterosexism, harassed)
ResponseT1 <- dplyr::select(dfSzyT1, cold, unresponsive, unsupportive)
StigmaT1 <- dplyr::select(dfSzyT1, negative, heterosexism, harassed)
```


## Calculating Item-Total Correlation Coefficients

Let's first ask, "Is there support for this instrument as a unidimensional measure?"  To do that, we get an alpha for the whole scale score.

The easiest way to do this is apply the *alpha()* function to a tiny df with the variables in that particular scale or subscale. Any variables should be pre-reversed.

```{r }
LGBTQalpha <- psych::alpha(LGBTQT1)#Although unnecessary, I have saved the output as objects because I will use the objects to create a table 
LGBTQalpha
```

Examining our list, the overall alpha is 0.64. Further, the average inter-item correlation (*average_r*) is .23.  
*And just hold up a minute, I thought you told us alpha was bad!*  

* While it is less than ideal, we still use it all the time, 
  + keeping in mind its relative value (does it increase/decrease, holding other things [like sample size] constant) and
  + also looking at alpha alternatives (such as we obtained from the omega output)
* Why alpha in this context?  Its information about *consistency* is essential.  In evaluating a scale's reliability we do want to know if items (unidimensionally or across subscales) are responding consistently high/middle/low.

We take note of two columns: 

* *r.cor* is the correlation between the item and the total-scale score WITH THIS ITEM INCLUDED. When our focus is on the contribution of a specific item, this information is not helpful since this column gets "extra credit" for the redundancy of the duplicated item.
* *r.drop* is the corrected item-total correlation. This is the better choice because it deletes the individual item being evaluated (eliminating the redundancy) prior to conducting the correlation.
  + Looking at the two columns, notice that the *r.drop* correlations are lower. This is the more honest correlation of the item with the *other* items.
  + In item analysis, we look for items that have relatively high (assessing redundancy or duplication) of items and relatively low (indicating they are unlike the other items) values. 
  
If we thought an item was problematic, we could eliminate it and rerun the analysis. Because we are looking at a list of items that "made the cut," we don't have any items that are concerningly high or low. For demonstration purposes, though, the corrected item-total correlation (*r.drop*) of the *unresponsive* variable was the lowest (.28). Let's re-run the analysis excluding this item.

```{r }
minus_unresponsive <- dplyr::select(dfSzyT1, cold,  unsupportive, negative, heterosexism, harassed)
```

```{r }
psych::alpha(minus_unresponsive) 
```

Both alpha (.58) and the overall inter-item correlations (*average_r*; .22) decrease. This decrease in alpha is an example of how sample size can effect the result.

Examining item-level statistics, we do see greater variability (.15 to .55) in the corrected item-total correlations (*r.drop*).  What might this mean?  

* The item we dropped (*unresponsive*) may be clustering with *cold* and *unsupportive* in a subordinate factor (think subscale).
* Although item analysis is more of a tool in assessing reliability, the statistical information that *unresponsive* provided may broaden the construct definition (definitions are a concern of *validity*) of perceptions of campus climate such that it is necessary to ground/anchor *cold* and *unsupportive*.

Tentative conclusion: there is evidence that this is not a unidimensional measure.

```{r }
RESPalpha <- psych::alpha(ResponseT1)
RESPalpha
```

The alpha for the College Response subscale is .79 much higher than the .64 of the total-scale. Similarly the average inter-item correlation (*average_r*) is higher (.56 versus .23). 

Examining the corrected item-total correlations indicates a strong correlation with the item (excluded) with the remaining variables (.59 to .69).

Let's look at the Stigma subscale.

```{r }
STIGalpha <- psych::alpha(StigmaT1)
STIGalpha
```

The alpha for the Stigma subscale is also much higher (.79) than the alpha for the total-scale (.64). Similarly the average inter-item correlation (*average_r*) is higher (.56 versus .23). 

Examining the corrected item-total correlations indicates a strong correlation with the item (excluded) with the remaining variables (.59 to .69).

In addition to needing strong inter-item correlations (which we just assessed) we want the individual items to correlate more strongly with themselves than with the other scale. Let's do that next.

## Correlating Items with Other Scale Totals

In this first analysis, we will correlate the individual items of the College Response scale to the Stigma subscale score.

```{r}
apaTables::apa.cor.table(dfSzyT1[c("cold", "unresponsive", "unsupportive", "StigmaT1")])
```

We want the items to have higher correlations with each other (.48 to .61) than with the StigmaT1 scale (-.02 to .09) with all three items). These are uncharacteristically low and are influenced by the simulation of raw data from factor loadings and the authors' excellent work in developing, evaluating, and retaining items that reflect two distinct factors.

Let's examine the individual items from the Stigma scale with the College Response subscale score.

```{r}
apaTables::apa.cor.table(dfSzyT1[c("negative", "heterosexism", "harassed", "ResponseT1")])
```

Again, the inter-item correlations are strong (.49 to .62) while their correlation with the College Response scale is 0.00

## Interpreting and Writing up the Results

Tabling these results can be really useful to present them effectively. As is customary in APA style tables, when the item is in bold, the value represents its relationship with its own factor. These values come from the corrected item-total (*r.drop*) values where the item is singled out and correlated with the remaining items in its subscale.

|Item-Total Correlations of Items with their Own and Other Subscales
|:-------------------------------------|

|Variables     |College Response |Stigma
|:-------------|:---------:|:---------:|
|cold          |**.69**    |-.02       |
|unresponsive  |**.61**    |.09        |
|unsupportive  |**.59**    |-.02       |
|negative      |-.05       |**.69**    |
|heterosexism  |-.01       |**.63**    |
|harassed      |.13        |**.59**    |

Although I pitched this type of item-analysis as *reliability*, to some degree it assesses within-scale **convergent and discriminant validity** because we can see the item relates more strongly to members of its own scale (higher correlation coefficients indicate *convergence*) than to the subscale scores of the other scales. When this pattern occurs, we can argue that the items *discriminate* well.

**Results**

Item analyses were conducted on the six items hypothesized to assess perceptions of campus climate for members of the LGBTQ community. To assess the within-scale convergent and discrimninant validity of the College Response and Stigma subscales, each item was correlated with its own scale (with the item removed) and with the other coping scale (see Table 1). In all cases, items were more highly correlated with their own scale than with the other scale. Coefficient alphas were .79, .79, and .64 for the College Response, Stigma, and total-scale scores, respectively. We concluded that the within-scale convergent and discriminant validity of this measure is strong.

For your consideration:
You are at your dissertation defense.  For one of your measures, the Cronbach’s alpha is .45.  A committee member asks, “So why was the alpha coefficient so low?”  On the basis of what you have learned in this lesson, how do you respond?

## A Conversation with Dr. Szymanski

Doctoral students Julian Williams (Industrial-Organizational Psychology), Jaylee York (Clinical Psychology), and I  were able to interview the first author (Dawn Szymanski, PhD) about the article [@szymanski_perceptions_2020] and what it means. Here's a direct [link](https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0f9696ab-df9a-452b-8ccd-aee101271054) to that interview.

Among other things, we asked:

* How were you able to create such an efficient (6 items) survey?
* What were the decisions around a potential third factor of *visibility*?
* What would you say to senior leadership on a college campus (where there hiring policies that discriminate against LGBTQIA+ applicants) who will acknowledge the research that indicates that the existence of such policies are associated with reduced well-being for members of the LGBTQIA+ community but who insists that their campus is different?
* How would you like to see the article used?

## Practice Problems
   
In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. For this lesson, please locate item-level data for a scale that has the potential for at least two subscales  and a total-scale score. Ideally, you selected such data for practice from the prior lesson. Then, please examine the following:

* produce alpha coefficients, average inter-item correlations, and corrected item-total correlations for the total and subscales, separately
* produce correlations between the individual items of one subscale and the subscale scores of all other scales
* draft an APA style results section with an accompanying table.

In my example, there were only two subscales. If you have more, you will need to compare each subscale with all the others. For example, if you had three subscales:  A, B, C, you would need to compare A/B, B/C, and A/C.

### Problem #1:  Play around with this simulation.

Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results.  

If item analysis is new to you, copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results. Perhaps you just change the number in "set.seed(210827)" from 210827 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.

### Problem #2: Use raw data from the ReCentering Psych Stats survey on Qualtrics.

The script below pulls live data directly from the ReCentering Psych Stats survey on Qualtrics. As described in the [Scrubbing and Scoring chapters](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReC_MultivariateModeling/) of the ReCentering Psych Stats Multivariate Modeling volume, the Perceptions of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale [@szymanski_perceptions_2020] was included (LGBTQ) and further adapted to assess perceptions of campus climate for Black students (BLst), non-Black students of color (nBSoC), international students (INTst), and students with disabilities (wDIS). Consider conducting the analyses on one of these scales or merging them together and imagining subscales according to identity/group (LGBTQ, Black, non-Black, disability, international) or College Response and Stigma across the different groups.

#Item numbers are supported with the following items:
#_1 "My campus unit provides a supportive environment for ___ students"
#_2 "________ is visible in my campus unit"
#_3 "Negative attitudes toward persons who are ____ are openly expressed in my campus unit."
#_4 "My campus unit is unresponsive to the needs of ____ students."
#_5 "Students who are_____ are harassed in my campus unit."
#_6 "My campus unit is cold and uncaring toward ____ students."

#Item 1 on each subscale should be reverse coded.
#The College Response scale is composed of items 1, 4, 6, 
#The Stigma scale is composed of items 2,3, 5
```


The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either a .csv file (think "Excel lite") or .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do).
```{r}
#write the simulated data  as a .csv
#write.table(climate_df, file="climate_df.csv", sep=",", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)
#bring back the simulated dat from a .csv file
#climate_df <- read.csv ("climate_df.csv", header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#to save the df as an .rds (think "R object") file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with
#saveRDS(climate_df, "climate_df.rds")
#bring back the simulated dat from an .rds file
#climate_df <- readRDS("climate_df.rds")
```

### Problem #3:  Try something entirely new.

Complete the same steps using data for which you have permission and access.  This might be data of your own, from your lab, simulated from an article, or located on an open repository.

Using the lecture and workflow (chart) as a guide, please work through all the steps listed in the proposed assignment/grading rubric.

## Bonus Reel: 

![Image of a filmstrip](images/film-strip-1.jpg)

For our interpretation and results, I created the table by manually typing in the results. Since there were only two subscales, this was easy. However, it can be a very useful skill (and prevent typing errors) by leveraging R's capabilities to build a table.

The script below

* Creates a correlation matrix of the items of each scale and correlates them with the "other" subscale, separately for both subscales.
* Extracts the r.drop from each subscale
* Joins (adds more variables) the analyses across the corrected item-total and item-other subscale analyses
* Binds (adds more cases) the two sets of items together

```{r}
Resp_othR <- psych::corr.test(dfSzyT1[c("negative", "heterosexism", "harassed", "ResponseT1")])#Run the correlation of the subscale and the items that are *not* on the subscale
Resp_othR <- as.data.frame(Resp_othR$r)#extracts the "r" matrix and makes it a df
Resp_othR$Items <- c("negative", "heterosexism", "harassed", "ResponseT1")#Assigning names to the items
Resp_othR <- Resp_othR[!Resp_othR$Items == "ResponseT1",]#Removing the subscale score as a a row in the df
Resp_othR[, 'StigmaT1'] <- NA #We need a column for this to bind the items later
Resp_othR <- dplyr::select(Resp_othR, Items, ResponseT1, StigmaT1) #All we need is the item name and the correlations with the subscales
RESPalpha <- as.data.frame(RESPalpha$item.stats)#Grabbing the alpha objet we created earlier and making it a df  
RESPalpha$Items <- c("cold", "unresponsive", "unsupportive")

Stig_othR <- psych::corr.test(dfSzyT1[c("cold", "unresponsive", "unsupportive", "StigmaT1")])#Run the correlation of the subscale and the items that are *not* on the subscale
Stig_othR <- as.data.frame(Stig_othR$r)#extracts the "r" matrix and makes it a df
Stig_othR$Items <- c("cold", "unresponsive", "unsupportive", "StigmaT1")#Assigning names to the items
Stig_othR <- Stig_othR[!Stig_othR$Items == "StigmaT1",]#Removing the subscale score as a a row in the df
Stig_othR[, 'ResponseT1'] <- NA #We need a column for this to bind the items later
Stig_othR <- dplyr::select(Stig_othR, Items, ResponseT1, StigmaT1) #All we need is the item name and the correlations with the subscales
STIGalpha <- as.data.frame(STIGalpha$item.stats)#Grabbing the alpha objet we created earlier and making it a df  
STIGalpha$Items <- c("negative", "heterosexism", "harassed")

#Combining these four dfs
ResponseStats <- full_join(RESPalpha, Stig_othR, by = "Items")
ResponseStats$ResponseT1 <- ResponseStats$r.drop
ResponseStats <- dplyr::select(ResponseStats, Items, ResponseT1, StigmaT1)
StigmaStats <- full_join(STIGalpha, Resp_othR, by = "Items")
StigmaStats$StigmaT1 <- StigmaStats$r.drop
StigmaStats <- dplyr::select(StigmaStats, Items, ResponseT1, StigmaT1)
ItemAnalyses <- rbind(ResponseStats, StigmaStats)
ItemAnalyses

#Writing them to a .csv file allows post-r formatting
write.csv(ItemAnalyses, file = "LGBTQ_Climate_ItemAnalyses.csv", sep = ",", row.names=TRUE, col.names=TRUE)
```
